Here i will show and explain a quick and easy method for better on device cyber sec for android devices

Hello today i am going to show a quick and easy method to cyber secure device when browsing online or using social media, i will tell you How to protect against phising and malware, hide your ip, stop your data getting taken and secure your Device. This way is for people who don't know anything about opsec i will be releasing a another repository soon for people who want to secure and encrypt there data more showing a much more in depth method with ways of how to set up i2p, a proxy, dnscrypt and dev settings etc etc. Anyways lets get on to this method for the people who dont know and use vpn services, cloudflare and google dns. 

THINGS YOU WILL NEED:
Android 10 or above device,
DuckDuckgo app https://duckduckgo.com/app,
Orbot app https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot/releases/tag/17.3.2-RC-1-tor-0.4.8.12
I suggest not to download these apps from google playstore as google does track you and it is best to stop as many leaks as possible.

Now lets how to set everything up perfectly to work and protect you,

Step1(dns&macchange):
Please go into network and internet settings and click onto private dns click Private DNS provider and input this url dns.quad9.net click save after click on internet and then your network name afterwards click network usage and treat as unmetered afterwards click privacy and use randomised MAC now exit settings.

What this does:
qaud9 dns will protect you against malware and phising and do not store or collect any of your data to stop phising leaks unlike google and cloudflare do. 

"Quad9 is a free service that replaces your default ISP or enterprise Domain Name Server (DNS) configuration. When your computer performs any Internet transaction that uses the DNS (and most transactions do), Quad9 blocks lookups of malicious host names from an up-to-the-minute list of threats. This blocking action protects your computer, mobile device, or IoT systems against a wide range of threats such as malware, phishing, spyware, and botnets, and it can improve performance in addition to guaranteeing privacy. The Quad9 DNS service is operated by the Swiss-based Quad9 Foundation, whose mission is to provide a safer and more robust Internet for everyone."

Setting your  network as unmetered stops most types of network monitoring where as metered allows network monitoring to keep in line with your network costs.

Randomising your mac allows the number that can be used to locate your device in networks to be different every time you have an internet connection rather than your device info and company shown it will show a random one instead like sometimes your device could be a fridge.

Step2(DDG):
Please go into DDG if you haven't set it up yet please do so (also if i suggest making this your main browser as they truly do protect and secure your browsing with 0 hidden trackers) after setting up DDG click the 3 dots then click app tracking then enable please go into vpn settings in network and internet then enable always on vpn.

What this does:
Any trackers aka data stealers hidden within applications you use will all be blocked, so anyone trying to phish for info and the applications company trackers that take your data and sell it to show you "3rd party ads"

Step3(orbot):
Please go into the orbot application allow notifications do not click connect it will mess with both the dns settings and DDG app tracking, click more then settings then follow these steps below,

Enable power user mode to stop it becoming a vpn connection.

Scroll down to connectivity tick all the isolate settings

After this please click back then click choose how to connect and click direct connection to tor then click connect 

What this does: 
It hides your ip address, cloaks your online traffic, hides your device and online fingerprint. 

Now your mobile device cyber sec is stronger and hardened also you should feel and see the increase in your internet speeds if you're stuck please take a look at my screenshots below screenshots are not in order.

Thank you
